                    <h2>How to choose a surfboard</h2>
                    <p>One of the most important rules is not to try to act like a professional if you had just started
                        to ride the waves. You might be impressed with an ad that show a top notch surfer riding his 
                        unbelievable board. This is not an appropriate board for you as it is meant for the surfers who
                        actually know how to ride a wave. This is not to discourage you from learning but it is really
                            hard to learn anything if your board was built for an extreme professional.</p>
                    <div class="media">
                        <img src="surfer.jpg" width="550" height="400" alt="surfing">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The right shape and the right size are the two most essential features when considering to buy a
                        surfboard. There are lot of surfers who choose a shorter board due to the fact that it looks rad
                        and cool. This is wrong as it needs to be similar to your body. If it is too short you are going
                        to fall and soon you will even lose the will to learn how to surf. You can find the proper size
                        for you by googling it and compare the results that you need. The right shape is not around the
                        corner as you need to form a certain a bond with your local dealer and let him suggest you a perfect board.
                    </p>
                    <div class="media">
                        <iframe width="550" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_azHA9quYg"></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        You might be willing to go surfing with somebody special so you can decide to choose a single
                        one or a twin one. Twin board is much bigger but it is easier to be with somebody else than surf alone.
                        If you live further away from the beach then it would be harder for you to carry it all the way to the beach.
                        Single one is more appropriate for lone surfers who are not a fan of big crowds.
                    </p>
